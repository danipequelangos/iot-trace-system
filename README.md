# IoT Trace System
This code implements an IoT system designed for waste traceability. This system records data from humidity and temperature sensors along with information obtained through a GPS device. With the intention of storing this information, a GSM module is implemented to send the information in json format via MQTT protocol.

# Dependencies
In addition to the libraries that appear in the code, the PubSubClient library modified for the operation of the system is attached in a folder.
